        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
            a) To notify the Agency immediately an Engagement is accepted; and
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
            b) To pay the fee of the Agency within 5 days of the date of the invoice
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
            c) To notify the Agency of an invoice dispute within 5 days of the date of the invoice, all disputes
            must be reported in writing to the Agency. Failure to dispute within this time period will result in the
            Agency rejecting any dispute.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
            The Agency reserves the right to charge interest accruing on a daily basis, on all outstanding invoices
            at a rate of 5% above the Bank of England base rate per annum.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
            3. For the purposes of the Regulations the Agency is engaged by the Client as an Employment
            Agency as defined in the Regulations.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-2">
            4. The fee payable to the Agency by the Client for the introduction of a candidate is based on the
            remuneration which the applicant is entitled to earn during the first 12 months of his/her
            engagement by the Client. If the candidate is paid on a weekly basis this will be charged by timing
            the wages by 52 weeks. Remuneration includes all taxable emoluments payable to or receivable by
            the candidate for services rendered to or on behalf of the Client, this includes car allowances. Where
            the candidate is offered a company vehicle, £6000 will be added to the salary for the purpose of
            calculating the fee.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
            The fee per candidate is calculated at 8% of the basic annual salary and are subject to VAT

            and/or associate basis. Price on enquiry and to be agreed in writing between the parties.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
            5. Should the Client fail to notify or disclose to the Agency of an Engagement of an introduced
            candidate then the Agency reserves the right to charge the Client the fee calculated in accordance
            with paragraph 4 which shall be payable immediately. If the Client fails to inform the Agency of the
            remuneration payable to an client following an Engagement then the introduction fee payable under
            this clause will be the higher of maximum remuneration specified by the Client for the vacancy or
            the candidate’s maximum salary expectation specified in the CV supplied to the Client by the
            Agency. No refund on an introduction fee will be made to the Client in the event of subsequent
            termination of such engagements.

            remuneration.
        </p>

            7. Introductions are confidential. The passing on of an introduction to another employer, associate
            or any affiliated party, which results in an Engagement renders the Client liable to payment of the
            Agency’s introduction fee as set out in Paragraph 4 with no entitlement to a rebate or refund.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">

            even if the introduction has been made indirectly. The fee is payable where the Agency have
            submitted the application of the candidate even if the applicant subsequently applies to the Client
            by any other source within a 12-month period from the date of the Agency’s Introduction. In such
            cases no replacement candidates will be covered under the guarantee set out in paragraph 12.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">

            subsequently re-engage the candidate within the period of 12 calendar months from the date of
            termination of an Engagement or withdrawal of an offer, a further fee calculated in accordance with
            paragraph 4 becomes payable, with no entitlement to any replacement candidates.

            way of set off, counterclaim, discount, abatement or otherwise unless the Client has a valid court
            order requiring an amount equal to such deduction to be paid by the Company to the Client. No
            payment shall be deemed to be received until the Agency has received cleared funds.
